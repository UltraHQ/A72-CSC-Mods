# A72-CSC-Mods
A magisk module adding native Call Recording and AppLock to the Galaxy A72!

You can add your own CSC Mods if you like, as the CSC files are decoded and besides the added features original.

#### Also compatible with: https://github.com/UltraHQ/A72-Hidden-Mods

### Installation:
1. Download the module from the releases
2. Open the magisk app and go to modules
3. Click the "Install from storage" button and select the .zip you just downloaded 

> Note: It should only be used on the Galaxy A72 (SM-A725F) running Android 11 with the corresponding android security patch version as written in the releases. Trying on other devices is at your own risk.<br/>The changes are always reversable, by simply removing the module in magisk.
