# A72-CSC-Mods
A magisk module adding native Call Recording and AppLock to the Galaxy A72!

Installation:
1. Download the module from the releases
2. Open the magisk app and go to modules
3. Click the "Install from storage" button and select the .zip you just downloaded 

> Note: It should only be used on the Galaxy A72 (SM-A725F) running Android 11. Trying on other devices is at your own risk. The changes are always reversable, by simply removing the module in magisk.
